		<h1>WizFight FAQ</h1>

		<h3>General Questions</h3>

		<p><b>Q: How feature-complete is the game?</b> <br />
		A: At this point in time, the game is a fully functional local multiplayer battleground that might have balance issues when certain wizards face off. There's still a lot of polish that needs to be worked on and the game needs much more content (especially in the way of the base set of maps), as well as some form of single-player mode, before I will consider it complete, however.</p>

		<p><b>Q: When does the game get updated?</b> <br />
		A: The newest build at the time is uploaded every other Tuesday.</p>

		<p><b>Q: Why is the download so large?</b> <br />
		A: Each of the game's music tracks is a 15-20 MB OGG format music file. I'm working on adding seamlessly looped tracks to alleviate this issue.</p>

		<p><b>Q: What language did you use to make the game?</b> <br />
		A: <a href="http://haxe.org">Haxe</a>, with the use of the library <a href="http://haxepunk.com">HaxePunk</a>.</p>

		<p><b>Q: Where can I find the latest news about the game?</b> <br />
		A: You can always find the latest news about the game on the <a href="http://tumblr.anotherdayanotherga.me/">blog</a> or the <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=33826.0">devlog on TIGSource</a>.</p>

		<p><b>Q: Will you be supporting Linux?</b> <br />
		A: Yes! Very soon(tm).</p>

		<p><b>Q: Will Platform X be supported?</b> <br />
		A: An Ouya version of the game is under consideration following performance issues on Ouya due to the large amount of particles the game uses but I am not considering any other platforms beyond Win/Mac/Linux and Ouya at this time.</p>

		<p><b>Q: If I bought the game on Store X and the game gets added to Store Y, can I get a copy of the game on Store Y?</b> <br />
		A: Sure. I understand that, in some cases, you buy a game before you're sure it will be on a specific storefront. Just send me proof of purchase and I will be happy to give you a copy on Store Y.</p>

		<h3>Common Problems</h3>

		<p><b>Q: Why is the game running at a low framerate?</b> <br />
		A: The game makes use of a lot of different particles and is not optimized well yet. Optimization will be an ongoing effort throughout alpha. In the meantime, the game may require at least a moderately good graphics card.</p>

		<p><b>Q: The game black screens on startup.</b> <br />
		A: To my knowledge, this issue has only occurred on Windows (if it occurs on any other system, post on the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adag_dot_me/wizfight/issues?status=new&status=open">issue tracker</a> entry for the issue with your system specs). Since it has occurred before, I have bundled the Windows version with two versions of the game that run in fullscreen mode and work slightly differently and one version that runs in windowed mode. Try the other fullscreen application first and if that fails, run it windowed and <a href="mailto:matt@anotherdayanotherga.me">email me</a> and/or post on the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adag_dot_me/wizfight/issues?status=new&status=open">issue tracker</a>.</p>

		<p><b>Q: My gamepad isn't working.</b> <br />
		A: WizFight only officially supports Xbox 360 gamepads. If you are on a Mac and your gamepad is not working, you may need the latest version of the <a href="http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver">Tattiebogle driver</a>. I've personally had issues with getting third-party Xbox 360 gamepads working on Mac and issues with specific gamepads on Mac are subject to the Tattiebogle driver's compatibility issues.</p>

		<p><b>Q: I can't assign controls to the Numpad.</b> <br />
		A: I am aware of this issue and am looking into a fix.</p>

		<p><b>Q: Issue X is occurring and it's not listed on the issue tracker or this FAQ.</b> <br />
		A: Post a new issue on the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adag_dot_me/wizfight/issues?status=new&status=open">issue tracker</a> or <a href="mailto:matt@anotherdayanotherga.me">email me</a> your best description of the issue.</p>

		<p><b>Q: How do I make my own levels?</b> <br />
		A: There is a comprehensive guide to making your own levels located <a href="levelcreation/levelcreation.html">here</a>.</p>

		<p id="designawiz"><h3>Design a Wizard</h3></p>

		<p><b>Q: What do I get with the Design a Wizard Edition?</b> <br />
		A: In addition to the game, along with access to all development builds, you get the chance to design a wizard and any extra bonuses that may be added later.</p>

		<b>Q: How do I redeem the wizard I get to design?</b> <br />
		A: I will contact you at the email you buy the game with shortly after your purchase.</p>

		<b>Q: How much control do I have over the design of the wizard I get to design?</b> <br />
		A: Almost complete control. Beyond being screened for offensive material, the wizard is subject to being balanced to match other wizards in the game. Other than that, you can design it to have whatever power, color palette, etc. that you want.</p>
