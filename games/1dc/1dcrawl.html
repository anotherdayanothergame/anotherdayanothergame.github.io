<p>1DCrawl is an upcoming 1-Dimensional dungeon crawler. You play a stereotypical hero trying to reach the top of a stereotypical tower and kill stereotypical enemies.</p>
<p>The majority of gameplay will consist of killing enemies, finding keys, and opening locked doors in an infinite, procedurally generated world with progressively increasing difficulty and leaderboards for the most stalwart heroes.</p>
<p>1DCrawl is planned to be out by the end of January 2012.</p>
