<p>The Crying Woods is a very short, very difficult game that is heavily inspired by roguelike games. It is the first game he's ever completed.</p>

<p>The game is based off of the legend of the Squonk, which you are attempting to catch. But first, you must travel through the woods, facing all sorts of threats, including a boss battle!</p>

<p>The game also includes an easter egg of sorts. It also doubles as a quick way to the end!</p>

<P>WASD to move, left click to shoot. Shots do one damage per hit. You start with 10 health and 5 ammo. Health packs have a + on them (very few of them exist!) and give 5 health, ammo packs are the other square-ish things lying around that give 10 ammo.</p>

<p>Bats (don't die) will instantly kill you on contact, wolves (5 hp) and the little frog things (5 hp) do 1 damage per hit, wolves jump around a lot, boss (2 hp) hits do 0.2 damage per hit. The squonk does not fight you and has 10 hp.</p>

<p>If you die, all that happens is you start over. Currently, score is completely arbitrary.</p>

<p>To download the original Game Maker 8.1 Lite version of the game, click <a href="http://www.endaron.com/games/cryingwoods1.0.exe">here</a>.</p>

<p>The game was planned to be rewritten in C++ with the use of SFML, but it's looking doubtful that that will happen.</p>
