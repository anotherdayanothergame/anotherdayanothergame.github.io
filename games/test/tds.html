	<td>A new prototype I've been working on. It's still very much a work in progress, with it missing animation, some proper sprites, a proper background, working score, proper advancement and difficulty scaling, optimization, and quite a bit more...</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Move with WASD. Click to shoot. Hit Space to go back in time (merges the timeline with 15 seconds ago...could bring back your past enemies, or double your current enemies! Also doubles you). If you have picked up a Turret, hit E to place it. If you have picked up a trap (blue box), hit Q to place it. You can order all of your past selves to the crosshair with F. By default, they will be in a horizontal formation. You can change between horizontal and vertical formations with Z. Your past selves will automatically start shooting at their nearest opposition. Currently, only aliens will attack the past selves. They, like you, gain health when they pick up health packs. However, they cannot pick up turrets and traps.</td>
