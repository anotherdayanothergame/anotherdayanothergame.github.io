I saw the light for the first time in ten years today. It's been ten years... Ten years since my father passed away and I was imprisoned for his crimes. Two years since I've seen any of the herd. They're probably scattered, if not all dead, by now. With the reputation my father willed them, it would come as no surprise. By the time he had passed, we had no friendly cities, and we were even beginning to fight amongst ourselves. The stress of it all was too much. Living on the road and killing when his plans went awry.
<br /><br />
He must have gone mad. That's the only explanation that has come to me in the past ten years. Accusing innocents of being spies for this or for that. For legions that did not affect us whatsoever. For people who did not know we existed, the humble traveling folk we were. He made sure they knew. He made sure that nearly everyone knew. And the herd hated him for it...
<br /><br />
Stepping outside of the prison, I was instantly left with an intense feeling of shock and remorse. The sprawling city I was imprisoned in had turned almost to rubble. The high-standing castles of sand and dirt had sunk almost entirely into the ground. Those that remained standing were missing entire floors, and those floors that remained were missing large pieces of wall. No single building looked suitable to live in any longer. Beggars littered the landscape for as far as I could see. Those that were not on the ground, asking to be spared this or that, were not much better off. They seemed only to differ insofar that they were dressed in clothes, rather than rags, and they were determined to push on, even though they knew they could not...
<br /><br />
I couldn't bear to stay there. The desperation that surrounded me was too much... I covered my eyes as they led me to my camel, and I rode off, hoping that the rest of the sea would be in a state better than this...
