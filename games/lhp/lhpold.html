	<td>A 2 or 4 player party game about hobos trying to collect as much food as they can before the other guys. It's still a bit rough around the edges and there's a lot of placeholder art, but it's playable and I think it'd be relatively fun to play with a full group. More maps and varying settings will be added semi-regularly.</td>
