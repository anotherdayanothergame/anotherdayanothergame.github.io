	<td><i>Don't Shoot Yourself!</i> is an experiment I did to see if people would enjoy a game where you could control your own movements, but the other player controlled when you shot. In its current form, it's no more than a prototype reminiscent of any sort of basic shoot back and forth game. Contrary to the title, the idea is to try and destroy yourself.<br /><br /></td>

	- Move: W and S<br />
	- Shoot: Spacebar<br /><br />

	- Move: Numpad 8 and 5<br />
	- Shoot: Numpad 0<br /><br /></td>

	<td>I apologize in advance if the controls are a bit weird. I wasn't sure how to set two people up on the same keyboard without getting in each other's way. :)</td>
