<center><h2>About Me</h2></center>

<p>Hey, my name is Matt Chelen. I'm an aspiring game designer/programmer from South Carolina, USA, and this is my About Me page. There's not a whole lot that I can think to say. I can be pretty opinionated. I'm interested in all sorts of odd programming on bizarre platforms. I'm not too good with actual code, but I'm a good enough writer, and have enough crazy ideas, that I'm determined to get within the "passable" range for being a programmer.
<br /><br />
If there's one thing I hope to accomplish, it's making games that are unique and enjoyable in memorable ways, even if it means frustrating the hell out of the user to get to the memorable parts.
<br /><br />
You can contact me at any time at <a href="mailto:matt@anotherdayanotherga.me">matt@anotherdayanotherga.me</a> and I will do my best to reply.
